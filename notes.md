1. I want an agent that looks at my different github locations and checks which is the most current. I store my documents in the same github for different laptops: screenpeekin/omagion is this computer, screenpeekin/beebook is the macbook, and screenpeekin/parros is a virtual machine. Often the different resositories have the same project. I need an agent that checks which which one is the most currently worked on. I want it to then update the git so it has a reference, and then copy the most current worked folder.
